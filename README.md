# rails-api-controller-generator

## Description
This generator is here to speed up the process of you writing boilercode for your rest-api Rails app.

This generator is highly opinionated. It creates files that fit the way I manage my files and directories inside a Rails project. Also, it assumes you are using: `rspec`, `dry-validation`, *use cases pattern* and *presenter pattern*.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-api-controller-generator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

In your project root folder execute:

    $ bundle exec rails generate api_controller Model action1 action2

Which will create following files:
* app/controllers/api/v1/models_controller.rb                                                                                 
* app/schemas/models_action1_schema.rb                                                                            
* app/use_cases/models/action1.rb                                                                                 
* app/schemas/models_action2_schema.rb                                                                            
* app/use_cases/models/action2.rb                                                                                 
* app/presenters/model_presenter.rb                                                                               
* app/presenters/models_presenter.rb                                                                              
* spec/requests/models_spec.rb
